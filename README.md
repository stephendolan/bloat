# Bloat

Bloat is a tiny wrapper around a [Thor](http://whatisthor.com) `apply` call, and allows running arbitrary Thor template code from anywhere!

## Installation

In a ruby project, you can add `bloat` to your `Gemfile`

For non-ruby projects, you'll need to install ruby, and then `gem install bloat`

## See it in action!

Let's check out using `bloat` to make templates from [RailsBytes](https://railsbytes.org) work in a [Lucky](https://luckyframework.org) application. We can add the lovely [StimulusJS](https://stimulusjs.org) library to our app with one command!
